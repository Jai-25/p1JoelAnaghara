### My Microwave ###
![Apartment Microwave]()
The issue with this design is that it has many buttons that no one uses. The interface is crowded when the microwave only needs the number pads, the start/pause button, the stop/clear button, and the add 30 seconds button. The buttons are small and it's hard to operate without fully giving it my attention. The top buttons are questionable, like why does my microwave have a 'Beverage' button. The user feedback is weird as well, when I use the add 30 seconds button or one of the pre-programmed buttons I don't get an instant feedback of how much time I will need to wait.

### Microwave Use ###
Microwaves are commonly used to warm up quick easy meals or leftovers. It's not used to cook ususally. When using the microwave it requires the user's full attention to make sure the right buttons are pressed. The +30 seconds button is probably used more than the number pad. If something is to be warmed for a minute the user will most likely press the +30 second button twice in rapid succession.

### My Design ###
For my improvements to the interface I decided to go with a simple, yet effective UI. The extra buttons are removed and keeps only what is necessary for a microwave. The number pad to punch in numbers makes up most of the UI. There is a strip above the number pad to display user feedback as usual. My UI can have a bigger display than many microwaves. This way the time is easy to see from far away, and in one quick glance from far you can tell if it is 23 or 28 seconds left. Next, to the 0 button is the crucial and highly used add 30 seconds button. This is probably going to be one of the most used buttons on the microwave, but I didn't want to remove the number pad as that would limit the user's input to increments of 30 seconds. With this design the user has a variety of options to input but still the simplicity they desire. The two biggest buttons on the bottom of the display is the Stop and Start button which I wanted to make easier to find. That's why they are placed at the bottom in a bigger sized button then everything else. A big thing I wanted to change with my UI design, is to make it easy to operate for the visually impaired. For my UI all the buttons are accompanied by braille. This way a blind person will be able to use my UI with ease. With the braille, my design is also easy to use for people who can see even when the lights are turned off or they are not fully looking at the microwave. The braille added to my design can also help teach those who can see braille and make them aware of the struggles people with disabilities go through.
